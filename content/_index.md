This is Xin Liu's personal website. I am an assistant researcher working at Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The website will has both English and Chinese posts. In the English posts, I will mainly write something about my research interest, observations and thoughts. 

The picture above shows the understory plant assemblage of subalpine coniferous forests in Eastern Tibetan Plateau, where bryophytes (mainly mosses and liverworts) are ubiquitous and critical in regulating biogeochemical cycles.
